#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because the running time depends on how many times n^2 fits into n^3. In other words the running time, depends on n^3/n^2, which reduces to n.


b) O(n^2) because the outer loop loops n times and the inner loop loops n - 1 times for every step of the inner loop. Hence, runtime is dependant on n(n - 1) or in other words effectively n^2


c) O(n) because the function runs once for every n where n > 0
